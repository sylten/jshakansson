        I built this website together with a good friend of mine, Joakim. We designed the architecture and built the entire website together. To be more effective I focused on building the front end and Joakim focused on the back end. The backend consists of an api built using .NET Core and SQL Server. It was hosted in Azure. The frontend framework used is Angular2, written in TypeScript. The frontend is hosted on a Node JS server and implements Angular Universal for server-side rendering.
